# Netlogo

These are some simulations I designed in Netlogo.

The first is the snake game (Snake.nlogo) with a lot of advanced features such as mazes, boosters, speed controls etc.

The second is a simulation which predicts how property prices affect demographics of a neighborhood. This can help understand how minor changes in a neighborhood i.e, a new amenity can eventually lead to gentrification.
